    <h2>What is a Lung Cancer?</h2>
    <p>
      Cancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow out of control. When cancer starts in the lungs, it is called lung cancer.<br>

      Lung cancer begins in the lungs and may spread to lymph nodes or other organs in the body, such as the brain. Cancer from other organs also may spread to the lungs. When cancer cells spread from one organ to another, they are called metastases.<br>

      Lung cancers usually are grouped into two main types called small cell and non-small cell (including adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma). These types of lung cancer grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is more common than small cell lung cancer.

      A number of factors may increase your risk of lung cancer. Some risk factors can be controlled, for instance, by quitting smoking. And other factors can't be controlled, such as your family history.<br>
      Risk factors for lung cancer include:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Smoking. Your risk of lung cancer increases with the number of cigarettes you smoke each day and the number of years you have smoked. Quitting at any age can significantly lower your risk of developing lung cancer.</li>
        <li>Exposure to secondhand smoke. Even if you don't smoke, your risk of lung cancer increases if you're exposed to secondhand smoke.</li>
        <li>Previous radiation therapy. If you've undergone radiation therapy to the chest for another type of cancer, you may have an increased risk of developing lung cancer.</li>
        <li>Exposure to radon gas. Radon is produced by the natural breakdown of uranium in soil, rock and water that eventually becomes part of the air you breathe. Unsafe levels of radon can accumulate in any building, including homes.</li>
        <li>Exposure to asbestos and other carcinogens. Workplace exposure to asbestos and other substances known to cause cancer — such as arsenic, chromium and nickel — can increase your risk of developing lung cancer, especially if you're a smoker.</li>
        <li>Family history of lung cancer. People with a parent, sibling or child with lung cancer have an increased risk of the disease.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>
      Lung cancer typically doesn't cause signs and symptoms in its earliest stages. Signs and symptoms of lung cancer typically occur when the disease is advanced.<br>
     <br>Signs and symptoms of lung cancer may include:
     <ul>
      <li>A new cough that doesn't go away</li>
      <li>Coughing up blood, even a small amount</li>
      <li>Shortness of breath</li>
      <li>Chest pain</li>
      <li>Hoarseness</li>
      <li>Losing weight without trying</li>
      <li>Bone pain</li>
      <li>Headaches</li>
